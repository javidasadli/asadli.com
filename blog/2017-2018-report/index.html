    <p>2017 was not good enough for me from learning aspect. I was studying university courses which were not so tough. But from 2017 I have actively started travelling across EU. However, winning Black Hat 2017 Europe student scholarship was a great success from my aspect. I wrote about the conference in my blog about Black Hat event. Additionally, it was my first trip to UK and to London ðŸ˜Š 
      2018 is one of the successful years of my life. Letâ€™s start from beginning January. I have travelled a lot to Turkey and Azerbaijan due to my girlfriend. We got engaged on March and married on May. After difficult visa procedures for my wife, we finally arrived at Estonia together on May. In June I have successfully defended my masterâ€™s thesis in Tallinn University of Technology. My thesis topic was about cyber security capacity building solutions for Azerbaijan. In July I have started working as a System Administrator in Birkle-It in Tallinn. In that position I have started learning new things from work mates and started my Devops first steps. 
      We have travelled a lot till end of year with my wife. This year was very productive from my aspect. I have got married, I have got Masterâ€™s Degree in Cyber Security and I have started work as a System Administrator in Birkle-it. However, life is going, and I am looking for new experiences and challenges. I have started learning python and German language. My main 2019 goal is to learn python and Deutche. See myself later ðŸ˜‰
